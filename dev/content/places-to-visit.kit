                        trails—ranging in
                        difficulty from Lower Horizon to Wacky Way—Mountain Creek is a great pick for family outdoor
                        fun. In addition to alpine skiing, Mountain Creek offers extra-small to large freestyle parks
                        for snowboarding and one of the area’s largest snow tubing parks. &#40;Parents: Imagine all the
                        fun
                        of sledding without the climb back up the hill!&#41; It’s easy to turn your ski day into a
                        slope-side overnight getaway with The Appalachian's one- and two-bedroom accommodations with
                        kitchens. Check out the resort’s stay packages and get the latest details on their COVID-19

                        seasonal
                        attractions in the Skylands. Take a winter hike along the Appalachian Trail at Wawayanda State
                        Park or go snowshoeing at High Point State Park, where you can catch a three-state view from
                        High Point Monument. Or angle for perch and pickerel at Hopatcong State Park, where both Lake
                        Hopatcong and Lake Musconetcong offer excellent ice fishing in the winter months. *Note: The
                        park is currently under a Harmful Algal Bloom &#40;HAB&#41; Watch and consuming fish is not
                        recommended
                        at this time. Please check the website for status updates before going fishing.</p>
