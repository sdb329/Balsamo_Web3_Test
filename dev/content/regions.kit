                        lighthouses, roadside produce stands and more, a beach day here is anything but ordinary.</p>
                    <p class="shore-p2">Beaches as far as the eye can see, with water activities and other things to do,
                        are the hallmark of the Shore Region. Fishing and bird watching are available at Island Beach
                        State Park in Seaside Heights.</p>
